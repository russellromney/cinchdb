## Phase 1 Implementation Approach
Following "Start Simple" principle:
1. **Config Class** - Simple TOML reader/writer for .cinchdb/config.toml
2. **Basic Models** - Minimal Pydantic models with essential fields only
3. **Path Utils** - Simple functions for directory management
4. **SQLite Setup** - Basic connection with WAL mode enabled

## Key Design Decisions
- Using SQLite in WAL mode with specific configurations
- Hierarchical structure: Project → Database → Branch → Tenant
- Git-like branching for database schemas
- Automatic id, created_at, updated_at fields
- JSON-based change tracking
- **Monorepo approach**: Python SDK/CLI/API bundled together

## Dependencies
- Core: pydantic, toml, typer, rich
- API: fastapi, uvicorn
- Dev: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy

## Key Commands
- `make install-all` - Install all dependencies
- `make dev` - Run API + Frontend
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make lint` - Check code quality
- `make build-all` - Build everything
- `cinch` - Main CLI command (after install)
- `cinch-server` - Start API server

## Key Technical Decisions
- WAL mode with autocheckpoint disabled for better concurrency

- Connection pooling for efficient multi-tenant access
- Strict separation between table models and metadata models
- Branch creation copies all tenants (as per design)
- Tenant creation copies schema but not data from main tenant
