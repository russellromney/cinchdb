# Active Context

## Recent Implementation: Remote CLI Access

### Summary
Implemented CLI support for accessing remote CinchDB instances via API using named aliases.

### What Was Done
1. **Updated config.py**: Added `RemoteConfig` model and `remotes` field to store remote configurations
2. **Added remote management commands**: Created `cinchdb remote` command group with:
   - `add <alias> --url <url> --key <key>` - Add remote configuration
   - `list` - Show all configured remotes
   - `remove <alias>` - Remove a remote
   - `use <alias>` - Set active remote
   - `clear` - Clear active remote
   - `show` - Show current active remote

3. **Updated CLI utils**: Added `get_cinchdb_instance()` function that:
   - Automatically uses active remote if configured
   - Supports `--local` flag to force local connection
   - Supports `--remote <alias>` to use specific remote

4. **Updated query command**: Modified to work with both local and remote connections

### How It Works
- Remote configurations stored in `.cinchdb/config.toml`:
  ```toml
  active_remote = "production"
  
  [remotes.production]
  url = "https://api.example.com"
  key = "your-api-key"
  ```
- All CLI commands transparently use remote connection when active
- CinchDB class already supported remote connections, so minimal changes needed

### Testing
- Added comprehensive tests for config and CLI utilities
- All tests passing

### Next Steps
- Other CLI commands already work with remote connections via the CinchDB class
- Could add progress indicators for remote operations
- Could add connection testing command (`cinchdb remote test <alias>`)
